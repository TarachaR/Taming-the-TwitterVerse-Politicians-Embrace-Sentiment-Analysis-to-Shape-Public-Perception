> ## 1. Executive Summary

***In the dynamic world of politics, public perception plays a crucial role in shaping the success or failure of a political figure. Leveraging the power of social media, particularly Twitter, has become an indispensable tool for political leaders to connect with their constituents, gauge public sentiment, and build a strong brand identity. However, effectively managing and understanding the vast amount of data generated on Twitter can be a daunting task. This is where Twitter sentiment analysis using NLP (Natural Language Processing) emerges as a powerful solution.***

> ## 2. Problem Statement

**Our client, a prominent political figure, seeks to enhance their brand reputation and strengthen their connection with their followers on Twitter. They recognize the importance of understanding public sentiment and identifying emerging trends in online conversations. However, manually analyzing the sheer volume of tweets directed at their account is a time-consuming and resource-intensive endeavor.**

</br>

> ## 3. Proposed Solution

**We propose implementing a Twitter sentiment analysis NLP project to automatically extract and analyze sentiment from tweets directed from the client's Twitter account. This solution will provide valuable insights into the public's perception of the client's policies, actions, and overall brand image.**

> ## 4. Data Pertinence and Attribution

**Data Source:**

- Twitter account: Dr. Miguna Miguna (@MigunaMiguna)
- Date range: January 1, 2019 - April 28, 2022
- Number of tweets: 43,479
- Attribution: The data used in this project was scraped from Twitter using Twint, an unofficial Twitter scraper. The data is publicly available on Twitter and is not owned by the author of this project.

> ## 5. Formulating the Benchmark of Success

The core benchmarks for success in this NLP Twitter analysis project will be: 

a) Building a classifier accuracy model with at least 80% precision in detecting tweet sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)

b) Providing actionable insights by identifying major influencers, topics, and events impacting changes in sentiment

c) Creating easy-to-understand data visualisations and reports to clearly communicate insights to our client. 

By developing a high-performance classification model and emphasizing practical, strategic business insights, our solution will enable our client to efficiently gauge public perception, track brand reputation, and guide future decisions - achieving their core goal of understanding and connecting with their followers at scale.
